This should work

------minigames ideas------
    
    -flappy bird --below difficult, how do we get things to move and spawn?
    -snake --difficult how do we get things to move and spawn and grow?

    -idle clicker --very simple, may need an end goal (code clicker, makes code appear as you click. once the page is full it means it's the end)
    -Rock, Paper, Scissors (lizard, spock) --easy to make, should work easily (int > string > bool > int)
    -Whack-a-mole --wack the error message
    -Fill in the blank --fix the code
    -pinball --very hard, how do we make everything? (coders need downtime)
